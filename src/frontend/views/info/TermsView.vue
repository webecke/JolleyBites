    you're agreeing to these Terms of Service.
    If you don't agree, please don't use the site.
    This document uses "we", "our", and "us", even though I'm just one guy.
  </p>

    Keep your password safe and don't share it.</p>

  <h2>We Can Terminate Access</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to our service for any reason,
    particularly if you violate these terms, but also if we just don't feel like maintaining this anymore.</p>
